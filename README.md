# NCT Trends
## A Brief Intro to NCT
Neo Culture Technology (or NCT) is a Korean pop music entertainment group that debuted with the concept of 'limitless' members. NCT started with 6 members, and now has 25 members. However, the group rarely operates with all 25 members. Instead, there are several subgroups, or 'units', that members operate in. Some members partake in multiple units. As of 2024, there are five units with a fixed permanent line-up: NCT 127, NCT DREAM, WayV, NCT WISH, and NCT DOJAEJUNG. There is also an unfixed unit called NCT U. The members of NCT U are different for each NCT U song, and any of the 25 members can partake in NCT U. So, members that best fit an NCT U song's concept will partake in that song.

## Project Goals & Design
The goal of this project is to provide insight on the following topics:
### 1. The relative popularity of each of the units.

### 2. The benefit of the 'limitless' unit system.

### 3. The popularity of different content types that are produced in-house.
